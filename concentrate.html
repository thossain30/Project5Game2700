        <p class="peace">With the amount of fluid you have, you should probably thoroughly douse one spot to make sure you get a strong blaze going. You find a dense bush, the base of which is a bed of pine straw and flowers. You take out the fluid, and start pouring it all over the bush, and all around the base until it's drenched. You take out your lighter, ignite it, and attempt to drop it over the bush, but you didn't anticipate how fast the concentrated fluid would light.</p>
        <p class = "chaosCon">Flames shoot up in front of your face, singing your eyebrows as well as burning the hand you dropped the lighter with. You leap back with an involuntary shout, and drop and roll in the grass just in case any part of you has caught fire. The fire is hot and bright, and in a moment you see a man hurry out of the church and down the steps, running towards you.</p>
        <p class="chaosCon">"What the hell is going on here? Are you alright??"</p>
        <p class="chaosCon">YOu get up from the ground and attempt to make up a story. "I was taking a smoke break and dropped my lighter..all of a sudden it was all on fire! Call 9-1-1 or something!"</p>
        <p class = "chaosCon">The man looks suspicious, but there's no more time for questions. He dials 9-1-1.</p>
        <p class="chaosCon">"They'll be able to get that contained before it spreads. Let's go warn the guests - but thank the Lord, the day will not be ruined."</p>
