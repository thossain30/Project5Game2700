            <p>The morning sun hits your face, and you roll over. A look at the clock shows that it’s 8am. Bright and early on the wedding day. You’re in a hotel bed anxious about the wedding. Only thing is, it's not your wedding. And you’re <b>in love with the bride.</b></p>

            <p>You were there the night Caley and Joseph met, three years ago. You and Joseph were at a Fourth of July party, and Caley met you both, a little sunburned but smiling. You fell in love with her the moment you saw her. And she fell in love with Joseph. You and Caley shared a drunken kiss shortly after the engagement, something you’ve never shared with anyone. And here you are, about to see the love of your life marry a friend. An acquaintance, really. Only invited because you were there when they met. </p>

            <p>You sit up in bed, rub the sleep out of your eyes. You check your phone. There’s a text, from 3 am last night. From Caley, of all people: “I need to talk to you”. You know, more certainly than you have ever known anything, that you have to <b>stop this wedding.</b></p>
