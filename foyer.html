        <p>The foyer would probably catch pretty well; there's a lot of old furniture and flammable decor. You can wait until the guests have arrived, and light it closer to the beginning of the ceremony. By the time they discover the fire, it'll be too late to stop it. It's time to wait.</p>
        <p>The guests have arrived, and everyone is finding their seats. You stand outside until you see no more people are arriving, and then make your way inside. <b>It's time.</b></p>
            <p>You take out the lighter fluid and begin dousing the thick carpet. Once a suitable amount is there, you use what's left on the furniture and the base of the walls. You survey the area for a moment, pull out your lighter, and ignite the fluid.</p></div>
        <p class = "chaosCon">However, right before you drop it, an old lady makes her way into the foyer. You freeze. She sees the lighter in your hand, and then smells the stench of the lighter fluid soaking in the carpet. She clutches her chest and screams, looking like she's about to faint. You hastily put the lighter away, and sprint out hoping that she wasn't able to get a good enough look at you to describe to the police.</p>
