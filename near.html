        <p>You figure that you should start it somewhere in the area immediately surrounding the main aisle. This would be close to all the guests, and would be the quickest way to disrupt the proceedings.</p>
        <p>You head to the store to get what you need. A lighter likely wouldn't be enough on its own, so you purchase a small container of lighter fluid. Now it's time to get ready for the ceremony.</p>
        <p>The wedding has begun. You've found a seat in the back row, and presently Joseph stands at the front. Caley will walk down the aisle soon. There's a long piece of cloth down the middle of the aisle leading towards the front, and there are flower arrangements on either side.</p>
