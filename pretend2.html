        <p>You keep your phone in one hand as you pull out the lighter fluid. You walk along the arrangements pouring out the lighter fluid with one hand while continuing to take photos with the other. You return the fluid to your pocket, and take out the lighter. You plan to start the fire small, and get away before it reaches the fluid and really ignites. You pull out the lighter, and hold it under one of the flowers, using your body to obscure what you're doing. But something happens that you didn't account for: the fluid dripped further down than you thought, and a flame immediately ignites in front of you.</p>
        <p>Eyes are drawn to your direction and you're the only one next to the fire. Shouts and screams ring out, and your turn to run, but before you know it you've been tackled to the ground. The flames grow and so does the chaos. You remain pinned to the ground; you hear more screams, and begin to smell smoke.</p>
        <p>The fire continues to spread as the guests scatter, but <b>you've been caught</b>. The police are soon notified, and you have no where to go but jail.</p>
