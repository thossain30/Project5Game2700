        <p class="chaos">Eventually, someone's grandmother in the front row spots the muzzle of a gun pointed in the window. She screams, and the ceremony dissolves into chaos. SWAT officers pour into the building, shouting for everyone to put their hands up. A great deal of confusion ensues. The officers can't figure out who the "kidnapper" is, and the guests can't figure out why there are so many guns pointed in their direction.</p>
