        <p>After an entirely too long Uber ride, you're standing outside the hair salon, experiencing what they call <b>"the moment of truth."</b></p>
        
        <p>You see Caley inside, looking beautiful, laughing with her bridesmaids. Do you really want to do this?</p>
        
        <p>Yes. You <a href="salon2.html">open the door</a>.</p>
            <p>No. You turn around and <a href="xoxo.html">walk away</a> before Caley could see you.</p>
