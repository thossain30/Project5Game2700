        <p>"He can be so violent," she says as you wrap her in a hug. You look over her shoulder at Joseph, who seems about to boil over with anger.</p>
        <p>"Let me get you out of here?" you ask gently. She nods, and you pull her away.</p>
        <p>You sit with her on a bench outside of the hotel for a long time. She cries, and tells you about all the things that have been happening behind the scenes over the last few months. Him getting too drunk and scaring her, or breaking things, or storming out of the house in irrational anger. You reassure her that she is safe and she doesn't have to marry him.</p>
        <p>She looks at you, "Are you just saying this because you love me?"</p>
        <p>"No," you reply. "Even if you don't want to be with me, I want you to be safe and happy."</p>
        
        <p>In the end, she calls off the wedding. A few months later, after the dust settles, you get a text from Caley.</p>
        
        <p>"Hey I need to talk to you." This time, you smile.</p>
